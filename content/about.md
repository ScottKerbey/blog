Hi, my name is Scott. I'm working as a Data Science in the Finance industry with a focus on technology and building robust production quality solutions.

On my website you can find personal projects that I am working on and blog posts about my work.

I am interested in talking about the 'Science' of Data Science. If you have an opinion on how to deliver results that are more than building a model and set and forget then reach out. I'm always looking for opportunities to network.
